## When to Reference Archive

### Good Reasons
- ✅ Understanding why a decision was made
- ✅ Finding implementation details from a specific task
- ✅ Historical context for code archaeology
- ✅ Understanding evolution of a feature

### Bad Reasons
- ❌ Learning current system (use master doc)
- ❌ Setup instructions (use master doc)
- ❌ API documentation (use master doc)
- ❌ Current workflows (use master doc)

## Cleanup Policy

Archive documents may be deleted after:
- 1 year for task reports
- 2 years for sprint documents
- 6 months for outdated docs (if no useful content)

Before deleting, verify:
- [ ] Information is captured in master doc or feature docs
- [ ] No unique implementation details lost
- [ ] Git history preserved for recovery if needed

---

**Remember**: Always check current documentation first!
