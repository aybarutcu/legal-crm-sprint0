# Matter Team Member System - Complete Implementation

## Overview

Implemented a robust team membership system for matters that allows lawyers and paralegals to be explicitly assigned to matters as team members. Team members have full access to all matter resources including workflows, documents, tasks, and events.

## Architecture

### Database Schema

#### New Table: `MatterTeamMember`

```prisma
model MatterTeamMember {
  id        String   @id @default(cuid())
  matterId  String
  userId    String
  role      Role     // Stores the user's role (LAWYER/PARALEGAL)
  addedAt   DateTime @default(now())
  addedBy   String?  // ID of user who added this member

  matter Matter @relation(fields: [matterId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  user   User   @relation("MatterTeamMembers", fields: [userId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)

  @@unique([matterId, userId])  // User can only be added once per matter
  @@index([matterId])
  @@index([userId])
}
```

**Key Features**:
- Unique constraint prevents duplicate memberships
- Cascading delete removes memberships when matter or user is deleted
- Stores role at time of assignment for audit purposes
- Tracks who added the member and when

### Access Control Flow

```
User requests matter/workflow/document
    ↓
Check: Is user ADMIN?
    ↓ No
Check: Is user matter owner?
    ↓ No
Check: Is user in teamMembers?
    ↓ No
Access Denied (403)
    ↓ Yes (any)
Access Granted
```

## Implementation Details

### 1. Core Utility Functions (`/lib/matter-team.ts`)

#### `addMatterTeamMember(params)`
Adds a user to a matter's team.

**Parameters**:
- `matterId`: Matter ID
- `userId`: User ID to add
- `addedBy`: ID of user performing the action

**Validation**:
- User must exist
- User must be LAWYER or PARALEGAL role
- Prevents duplicate memberships (idempotent)

**Returns**: MatterTeamMember with user details

#### `removeMatterTeamMember(params)`
Removes a user from a matter's team.

**Parameters**:
- `matterId`: Matter ID
- `userId`: User ID to remove

**Note**: Does not prevent removing the matter owner (business logic TBD)

#### `getMatterTeamMembers(matterId)`
Retrieves all team members for a matter.

**Returns**: Array of team members with user details (name, email, role, isActive)

#### `isMatterTeamMember(matterId, userId)`
Quick check if a user is a team member or owner.

**Returns**: Boolean

#### `syncMatterOwnerToTeam(matterId)`
Automatically adds matter owner as a team member (if LAWYER/PARALEGAL).

**Use case**: Call after matter creation to ensure owner is in team

### 2. Updated Authorization (`/lib/authorization.ts`)

#### `assertMatterAccess(user, matterId)`

**Before**:
```typescript
// Only checked if user was owner
if (matter?.ownerId !== user.id) {
  throw new NotAuthorizedError();
}
```

**After**:
```typescript
// Check owner OR team membership
const hasAccess = 
  matter?.ownerId === user.id || 
  (matter?.teamMembers && matter.teamMembers.length > 0);
```

**Impact**: All workflow endpoints now respect team membership:
- `/api/workflows/instances` - List workflows
- `/api/workflows/instances/[id]` - View instance details
- `/api/workflows/instances/[id]/context` - Context operations
- `/api/workflows/instances/[id]/steps` - Step management
- `/api/workflows/instances/[id]/steps/[stepId]` - Step actions

### 3. Workflow Actor Resolution (`/lib/workflows/roles.ts`)

#### `loadWorkflowActorSnapshot(prisma, matterId)`

**Before**:
```typescript
// Loaded eligible actors from task assignments
tasks: {
  select: {
    assignee: { select: { id: true, role: true } }
  }
}
```

**After**:
```typescript
// Load eligible actors from team members
teamMembers: {
  select: {
    user: { select: { id: true, role: true } }
  }
}
```

**Result**: 
- Lawyers on the team can execute LAWYER-scoped workflow steps
- Paralegals on the team can execute PARALEGAL-scoped workflow steps
- No longer requires task assignment to execute steps

### 4. Task Service Updates (`/lib/tasks/service.ts`)

#### `buildMatterAccessFilter(user)`

**Before**:
```typescript
OR: [
  { ownerId: user.id },
  { tasks: { some: { assigneeId: user.id } } }
]
```

**After**:
```typescript
OR: [
  { ownerId: user.id },
  { teamMembers: { some: { userId: user.id } } }
]
```

**Impact**: Task queries now filter by team membership instead of task assignment

### 5. Workflow Instances API (`/app/api/workflows/instances/route.ts`)

#### GET `/api/workflows/instances?matterId=X`

**Before**:
```typescript
matter: {
  OR: [
    { ownerId: user.id },
    { tasks: { some: { assigneeId: user.id } } }
  ]
}
```

**After**:
```typescript
matter: {
  OR: [
    { ownerId: user.id },
    { teamMembers: { some: { userId: user.id } } }
  ]
}
```

### 6. Team Management API (`/app/api/matters/[id]/team/route.ts`)

#### GET `/api/matters/[id]/team`
Returns all team members for a matter.

**Authorization**: Any user with matter access

**Response**:
```json
[
  {
    "id": "team_member_id",
    "matterId": "matter_id",
    "userId": "user_id",
    "role": "LAWYER",
    "addedAt": "2025-10-16T...",
    "addedBy": "admin_id",
    "user": {
      "id": "user_id",
      "name": "John Doe",
      "email": "john@example.com",
      "role": "LAWYER",
      "isActive": true
    }
  }
]
```

#### POST `/api/matters/[id]/team`
Adds a team member to a matter.

**Authorization**: ADMIN or LAWYER only

**Request Body**:
```json
{
  "userId": "user_id_to_add"
}
```

**Response**: Created team member (201)

**Errors**:
- 403: Not authorized (must be ADMIN/LAWYER)
- 400: Invalid userId or user not found
- 400: User must be LAWYER or PARALEGAL

#### DELETE `/api/matters/[id]/team`
Removes a team member from a matter.

**Authorization**: ADMIN or LAWYER only

**Request Body**:
```json
{
  "userId": "user_id_to_remove"
}
```

**Response**: Success indicator (200)

## Migration

### Script: `/scripts/migrate-matter-teams.ts`

Populates the `MatterTeamMember` table from existing data:

1. **Adds Matter Owners**:
   - Finds all matters with owners
   - Adds owners as team members (if LAWYER/PARALEGAL)
   
2. **Adds Task Assignees**:
   - Finds all unique task assignees per matter
   - Adds them as team members (if LAWYER/PARALEGAL)
   - Deduplicates to avoid adding same user twice

**Run**:
```bash
npx tsx scripts/migrate-matter-teams.ts
```

**Output**:
```
Found 6 matters to process

Processing: Doe vs. Corp. (matter_id)
  ✓ Added: John Doe (LAWYER)
  ✓ Added: Jane Smith (PARALEGAL)

Migration complete!
  Added: 12 team members
  Skipped: 3 (already existed)
```

## Usage Examples

### Frontend: Adding Team Members

```typescript
// Add a paralegal to the matter team
const response = await fetch(`/api/matters/${matterId}/team`, {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({ userId: paralegalId })
});

if (response.ok) {
  const member = await response.json();
  console.log('Added team member:', member);
}
```

### Frontend: Listing Team Members

```typescript
// Get all team members
const response = await fetch(`/api/matters/${matterId}/team`);
const members = await response.json();

// Display team
members.forEach(member => {
  console.log(`${member.user.name} (${member.role})`);
});
```

### Frontend: Removing Team Members

```typescript
// Remove a team member
await fetch(`/api/matters/${matterId}/team`, {
  method: 'DELETE',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({ userId: memberUserId })
});
```

### Backend: Checking Team Membership

```typescript
import { isMatterTeamMember } from '@/lib/matter-team';

const isMember = await isMatterTeamMember(matterId, userId);
if (!isMember) {
  return res.status(403).json({ error: 'Not a team member' });
}
```

### Backend: Auto-adding Owner on Matter Creation

```typescript
import { syncMatterOwnerToTeam } from '@/lib/matter-team';

// After creating a matter
const matter = await prisma.matter.create({ data: { ... } });

// Add owner to team
await syncMatterOwnerToTeam(matter.id);
```

## Security Considerations

### What This System Allows

✅ **Team members can**:
- View matter details
- View all workflows on the matter
- View all documents on the matter
- View all tasks on the matter
- Execute workflow steps matching their role scope
- View matter events and calendar entries
- Add notes and comments

### What This System Restricts

❌ **Team members cannot**:
- Execute workflow steps outside their role scope (PARALEGAL can't do LAWYER steps)
- Add/remove other team members (unless they're ADMIN or LAWYER)
- Delete the matter (unless they're the owner or ADMIN)
- Change matter ownership

❌ **Non-team members cannot**:
- Access any matter resources
- See workflows, documents, or tasks
- Execute any workflow steps

### Permission Layers

1. **Matter Access** (Team Membership):
   - Is user ADMIN, owner, or team member?
   - Controls visibility of matter and all related resources

2. **Workflow Step Execution** (Role Scope):
   - Is user's role eligible for this step?
   - Uses `canPerformAction()` and `loadWorkflowActorSnapshot()`
   - PARALEGAL can only execute PARALEGAL-scoped steps
   - LAWYER can only execute LAWYER-scoped steps

3. **Action Authorization** (Admin/Lawyer):
   - Some actions require ADMIN or LAWYER role
   - Adding/removing team members
   - Deleting matters
   - Publishing workflow templates

## Testing

### Manual Testing

1. **Setup**:
```bash
# Run migration
npx tsx scripts/migrate-matter-teams.ts
```

2. **Test as Paralegal**:
   - Login as paralegal user
   - Navigate to a matter where you're a team member
   - ✅ Verify you can see the matter
   - ✅ Verify workflows section is visible
   - ✅ Verify documents are accessible
   - ✅ Verify you can execute PARALEGAL-scoped steps
   - ❌ Verify you CANNOT execute LAWYER-scoped steps

3. **Test Team Management**:
   - Login as lawyer (matter owner)
   - Add a paralegal via `/api/matters/[id]/team`
   - ✅ Verify paralegal now has access
   - Remove the paralegal
   - ❌ Verify paralegal no longer has access

### API Testing

```bash
# Get team members
curl http://localhost:3000/api/matters/MATTER_ID/team \
  -H "Cookie: next-auth.session-token=TOKEN"

# Add team member
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/matters/MATTER_ID/team \
  -H "Cookie: next-auth.session-token=TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"userId":"USER_ID"}'

# Remove team member
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:3000/api/matters/MATTER_ID/team \
  -H "Cookie: next-auth.session-token=TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"userId":"USER_ID"}'
```

## Performance Impact

### Database Queries

**Before** (Task-based):
```sql
-- Check access: Join through tasks
SELECT * FROM Matter m
LEFT JOIN Task t ON t.matterId = m.id
WHERE m.id = ? AND (m.ownerId = ? OR t.assigneeId = ?)
```

**After** (Team-based):
```sql
-- Check access: Direct team membership
SELECT * FROM Matter m
LEFT JOIN MatterTeamMember tm ON tm.matterId = m.id
WHERE m.id = ? AND (m.ownerId = ? OR tm.userId = ?)
```

**Impact**: 
- ✅ More direct relationship
- ✅ Better index utilization
- ✅ Cleaner separation of concerns
- ⚠️ Adds one more table to maintain

### Indexes

All critical paths are indexed:
```prisma
@@index([matterId])  // Find all members of a matter
@@index([userId])    // Find all matters for a user
@@unique([matterId, userId])  // Prevent duplicates
```

## Future Enhancements

### 1. Team Roles
Add more granular roles within a team:
```prisma
enum TeamMemberRole {
  LEAD          // Can manage team
  COLLABORATOR  // Full access
  OBSERVER      // Read-only
}
```

### 2. UI Components
- Team member picker/selector
- Team member list with avatars
- "Add to team" button on matter detail page
- Team activity feed

### 3. Notifications
- Notify users when added to a matter team
- Notify team when new workflows are created
- Daily digest of team activity

### 4. Analytics
- Track team productivity
- Measure collaboration patterns
- Identify bottlenecks

### 5. Bulk Operations
- Add multiple users at once
- Import team from template
- Copy team from another matter
