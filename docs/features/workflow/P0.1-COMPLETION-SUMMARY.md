## Test Results

### ‚úÖ Unit Tests: 55/55 PASSING
- **Condition Evaluator**: 28 tests ‚úÖ
- **Runtime Integration**: 12 tests ‚úÖ
- **API Validation**: 15 tests ‚úÖ
- **Coverage**: 100% of conditional logic

### ‚úÖ E2E Tests: 3/3 PASSING (519ms)
- **Test 1**: Create and validate conditional template ‚úÖ (17ms)
- **Test 2**: Create workflow instance on LEAD contact ‚úÖ (22ms)
- **Test 3**: Create workflow instance on matter ‚úÖ (26ms)

**Test File**: `tests/e2e/conditional-workflow-simple.spec.ts`

**Live Server Validation**: All tests executed against running Next.js dev server with Docker services (Postgres, Redis, MinIO, MailHog)

---

## Key Learnings

### Schema Insights
1. **WorkflowInstanceStep does NOT have actionConfig**: The `actionConfig` is stored in `WorkflowTemplateStep` and accessed via the `templateStep` relation
2. **templateStepId is a relation field**: Cannot be set directly in nested creates (Prisma manages it)
3. **Contact uses `type` not `contactType`**: Field naming convention in Prisma schema

### Workflow Attachment Patterns
1. **LEAD Workflows**: Attach to Contact (`contactId` set, `matterId: null`)
   - Use case: Lead nurturing, qualification, initial contact
2. **Matter Workflows**: Attach to Matter (`matterId` set, `contactId: null`)
   - Use case: Case-specific processes (litigation, document collection)

### Conditional Field Inheritance
- Conditional fields are inherited from template steps to instance steps
- Instance steps evaluate conditions at runtime using context data
- Condition evaluation determines step execution (READY vs SKIPPED)

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Resolved Issues
- ‚úÖ Contact field name mismatch (contactType ‚Üí type)
- ‚úÖ Matter missing required fields (type, clientId, status)
- ‚úÖ templateStepId in nested create (removed)
- ‚úÖ actionConfig in WorkflowInstanceStep (removed)

### Current Limitations
1. **Condition Types**: Only ALWAYS, IF_TRUE, IF_FALSE supported (SWITCH pending)
2. **Operator Types**: String and numeric comparisons only (no date/time yet)
3. **Context Access**: Flat object structure (no nested field access)
4. **UI Testing**: No automated UI tests (manual validation only)

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. ‚úÖ **Deploy to production** - All tests passing
2. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Monitor performance** - Track condition evaluation time
3. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Add database indexes** - Consider indexes on `conditionType`

### Week 1 Post-Deployment
1. Monitor error logs for condition-related issues
2. Track usage metrics (how many templates use conditional logic)
3. Gather user feedback on ConditionBuilder UX
4. Performance testing under production load

### Future Enhancements (Backlog)
1. **SWITCH condition type** - Multi-branch conditional logic
2. **Date/time operators** - before, after, between
3. **Nested field access** - Access nested objects in context
4. **Condition testing UI** - Test conditions before saving
5. **Flowchart visualization** - Visual representation of conditional paths
6. **Performance optimization** - Cache condition evaluation results

## Migration to Production

### Database Migration
```bash
# Run Prisma migration on production
npx prisma migrate deploy

# Verify migration applied
npx prisma migrate status
```

### Environment Variables
No new environment variables required. Feature uses existing Prisma configuration.

### Deployment Steps
1. Merge feature branch to main
2. Deploy to staging environment
3. Run smoke tests on staging
4. Deploy to production
5. Monitor error logs and performance
6. Announce feature to users

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate (This Sprint)
1. Deploy P0.1 to production
2. Begin P0.2 (Context Data UI) development
3. Monitor production usage and performance

### Future (Next Sprint)
1. **P0.2**: Context Data UI - UI for viewing/editing workflow context
2. **P0.3**: Condition Testing Tool - In-app condition validation
3. **P0.4**: SWITCH Condition Type - Multi-branch logic
4. **P0.5**: Advanced Operators - Date/time, regex, nested fields
