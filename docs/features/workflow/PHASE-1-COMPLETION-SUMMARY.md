## Technical Details

### Dependencies Used

- ‚úÖ `reactflow` (v11.x) - Already installed
- ‚úÖ `dagre` (v0.8.5) - Already installed (for auto-layout in Phase 4)

No new dependencies required!

### File Structure

```

app/(dashboard)/workflows/templates/_components/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ client.tsx                   (UPDATED)
```

### Type System

Created `WorkflowStep` interface in WorkflowCanvas.tsx:
- Compatible with existing template editor
- Maps to Prisma types (ActionType, Role)
- Supports all dependency features

### Validation

Custom cycle detection algorithm:
- Uses Depth-First Search (DFS)
- Detects cycles before allowing connection
- Shows error: "Circular dependency detected: Step 1 ‚Üí Step 2 ‚Üí Step 1"
- Prevents invalid workflows from being saved

## Known Limitations (To Be Fixed in Later Phases)

### Phase 1 Scope

‚úÖ **Completed**:
- Canvas foundation
- Node display
- Basic interactions
- Real-time validation

‚è≥ **Not Yet Implemented** (Future Phases):
- Auto-layout (Phase 4)
- Drag to reposition nodes (Phase 2)
- Undo/Redo (Phase 7)
- Keyboard shortcuts (Phase 7)
- Pattern library (Phase 8)
- Export as PNG/SVG (Phase 8)

### Current Behavior

**Node Positioning**:
- Nodes currently stack vertically (Y = order * 150)
- Manual drag-to-reposition NOT YET implemented
- Auto-arrange button NOT YET added

**Will be fixed in Phase 2 (Node Management) & Phase 4 (Auto-Layout)**

## Testing Checklist

### Manual Testing

- [x] Server starts without errors (`npm run dev`)
- [ ] Navigate to workflow templates page
- [ ] Click Canvas tab (should render without crashing)
- [ ] Add node via palette
- [ ] Create dependency connection
- [ ] Edit node properties
- [ ] Delete node
- [ ] Validation banner shows status
- [ ] Switch between Form/Canvas/Graph views

### To Test

Run these tests manually:

```bash
# 1. Start dev server (already running)
npm run dev

  ‚úì Empty canvas with help banner
  ‚úì Node palette on left
  ‚úì Validation banner on top
  ‚úì Minimap in corner
  ‚úì Zoom controls

# 4. Test Adding Nodes

- Click "Approval" in palette
- Second node appears below first

# 5. Test Dependencies
- Hover over first node bottom (green dot)

- Validation banner should show error

# 8. Test View Switching
- Click "Form" tab
- Should see form editor with 3 steps

## Next Steps

### Phase 2: Node Management (2-3 hours)

**Implement**:

- Recalculate orders based on Y position
- Smart node placement (avoid overlaps)
- Better delete confirmation

**Files to Update**:
- `WorkflowCanvas.tsx` - Add `onNodeDragStop` handler
- `WorkflowCanvas.tsx` - Implement `recalculateOrdersByPosition`

### Phase 3: Connection Management (3-4 hours)

**Enhance**:
- Better visual feedback while dragging
- Preview edge before drop
