# WRITE_TEXT Action - UI Integration Complete

## Overview

Successfully integrated the WRITE_TEXT workflow action into all workflow creation and editing interfaces across the application. Users can now select "Write Text" as an action type when creating or editing workflow steps in both workflow templates and workflow instances.

## Files Modified

### 1. ‚úÖ `/components/matters/workflows/types.ts`
**Change**: Added `WRITE_TEXT` to ActionType union

```typescript
export type ActionType =
  | "CHECKLIST"
  | "APPROVAL_LAWYER"
  | "SIGNATURE_CLIENT"
  | "REQUEST_DOC_CLIENT"
  | "PAYMENT_CLIENT"
  | "WRITE_TEXT";  // NEW
```

**Impact**: Core type definition used by all workflow instance components

---

### 2. ‚úÖ `/components/matters/MatterDetailClient.tsx`
**Changes**:
- Added `WRITE_TEXT` to local ActionType union
- Added default config for WRITE_TEXT in `defaultConfigFor()` function

```typescript
case "WRITE_TEXT":
  return {
    title: "",
    description: "",
    placeholder: "Enter your text here...",
    minLength: 0,
    maxLength: undefined,
    required: true,
  };
```

**Impact**: Matter detail page can now create workflow instances with WRITE_TEXT steps

---

### 3. ‚úÖ `/components/matters/workflows/WorkflowInstanceCard.tsx`
**Change**: Added "Write Text" option to action type dropdown

```html
<select id="step-action-type">
  <option value="CHECKLIST">Checklist</option>
  <option value="APPROVAL_LAWYER">Lawyer Approval</option>
  <option value="SIGNATURE_CLIENT">Client Signature</option>
  <option value="REQUEST_DOC_CLIENT">Request Document from Client</option>
  <option value="PAYMENT_CLIENT">Client Payment</option>
  <option value="WRITE_TEXT">Write Text</option>  <!-- NEW -->
</select>
```

**Impact**: Workflow instance step creation/editing forms now include WRITE_TEXT option

---

### 4. ‚úÖ `/components/matters/workflow-dialog.tsx`
**Change**: Added `WRITE_TEXT` to local ActionType union

```typescript
type ActionType =
  | "APPROVAL_LAWYER"
  | "SIGNATURE_CLIENT"
  | "REQUEST_DOC_CLIENT"
  | "PAYMENT_CLIENT"
  | "CHECKLIST"
  | "WRITE_TEXT";  // NEW
```

**Impact**: Workflow instantiation dialog from templates now supports WRITE_TEXT steps

---

### 5. ‚úÖ `/app/(dashboard)/workflows/templates/_components/client.tsx`
**Changes**:
- Added WRITE_TEXT to ACTION_TYPES array with label "Write Text"
- Added default config for WRITE_TEXT in `defaultConfigFor()` function
- Updated WorkflowStep type to accept `string` for actionType/roleScope (for imported templates)
- Added type casts where needed for type safety

```typescript
const ACTION_TYPES = [
  { value: "CHECKLIST", label: "Checklist" },
  { value: "APPROVAL_LAWYER", label: "Lawyer Approval" },
  { value: "SIGNATURE_CLIENT", label: "Client Signature" },
  { value: "REQUEST_DOC_CLIENT", label: "Request Documents" },
  { value: "PAYMENT_CLIENT", label: "Client Payment" },
  { value: "WRITE_TEXT", label: "Write Text" },  // NEW
] as const;
```

**Impact**: Workflow template editor now includes WRITE_TEXT in action type selector

## Configuration Form Integration

All interfaces automatically use the `WriteTextConfigForm` component when WRITE_TEXT is selected:

**Form Fields**:
- ‚úÖ Title (required) - Text input
- ‚úÖ Description (optional) - Textarea
- ‚úÖ Placeholder (optional) - Text input
- ‚úÖ Min Length (optional) - Number input
- ‚úÖ Max Length (optional) - Number input
- ‚úÖ Required (default: true) - Checkbox
- ‚úÖ Live Preview - Shows how the form will look to users

**Form Location**: `/components/workflows/config-forms/WriteTextConfigForm.tsx`

**Automatic Integration**: The `ActionConfigForm` component automatically renders the correct form based on selected action type.

---

## Display Integration

All interfaces automatically use the `ActionConfigDisplay` component to show WRITE_TEXT configuration:

**Display Elements**:
- üìù FileEdit icon (indigo color)
- üìù Title with required indicator (*)
- üìù Description text
- üìù Character length constraints (if configured)

**Display Location**: `/components/workflows/ActionConfigDisplay.tsx`

**Shown In**:
- Workflow template cards (step list)
- Workflow instance cards (step list)
- Template instantiation dialog (step preview)

---

## Execution Integration

When a WRITE_TEXT step is IN_PROGRESS, the execution UI is automatically rendered:

**Execution UI**:
- Large textarea (8 rows)
- Real-time character counter
- Length validation with visual feedback
- Error messages for validation failures
- Submit button with loading state

**Execution Location**: `/components/workflows/execution/WriteTextExecution.tsx`

**Shown In**:
- Matter detail page > Workflows tab > Step cards (when step is in progress)

## Summary

The WRITE_TEXT workflow action is now **fully integrated** into all workflow creation and editing interfaces:

1. ‚úÖ **Workflow Template Editor** - Can create templates with WRITE_TEXT steps
2. ‚úÖ **Matter Detail Workflows** - Can add WRITE_TEXT steps to instances
3. ‚úÖ **Template Instantiation** - Can instantiate templates with WRITE_TEXT steps

Users can now:
- Select "Write Text" from action type dropdowns
- Configure text writing requirements with full-featured form
- See text writing configuration in step lists
- Execute text writing steps with dedicated UI
- View completed text in execution logs

The integration maintains **full backwards compatibility** and requires **no data migration**. All interfaces automatically handle WRITE_TEXT through the existing component architecture.

**Integration Date**: December 2024  
**Status**: ‚úÖ Complete - Ready for Testing  
**Next Action**: Manual testing and user acceptance testing
